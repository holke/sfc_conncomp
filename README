This project implements the program
compute_cc
which calculates the number of connected components of the 
tetrahedral or cubical Morton curve for a given refinement level in 2D or 3D.

INSTALLATION

This program depends on the t8code library commit 807f9488d97d35f
t8code can be found at https://github.com/holke/t8code.

Install t8code as an external library in a folder.

Edit the entries BASE_DIR and T8_DIR in the file ./exec/compile.

$ cd ./exec
$ source compile

The source call is necessary to export the correct t8code library.
In subsequent calls, only ./compile is necessary.


USAGE

The program exec/compute_cc accepts two options:
 -d [num]       num is either 2 or 3 and specifies the dimension (triangle or tetrahedra)
 -l [num]       num is a non-negative integer and specifies the uniform refinement level
 -c             Switch from simplicial to cubical Morton curve.

The program is parallelized with MPI. To run a parallel version with p processes, call

$ mpirun -np p ./compute_cc -d [num] -l [num]





TODO

Configure the project with autotools or cmake to automate the installation process.
